The Flying Dutchman
This project is for the course User Interface Programming I.
Project group: Across the Equator with Red Sails in the Sunset .
Group members: Tuva Kind, Samuel Medlock and Elma Harmsen.

How to run the program
The programming has been done with HTML, CSS an JavaScript. You do not need any extra  software or similar to run the Flying Dutchman interface on your computer. You only need to open it in the code editor and open the index.html file in the browser. We recommend you use the extension ‘Live Server', since it opens a local server in your browser and is very easy to use. 

Problems remaining
We have succeeded in developing many features and functionalities. However, not everything was managed in time, and some problems remained to be solved. 
•	The drag-and-drop is not be guaranteed to work on certain browsers, since it may not be compatible. Yet, it should work on Firefox. 
•	The drag-and-drop is not flawless, because the drop zone is limited and when all space is taken it is not possible to drop more beverages in the order list.
•	Also the undo-redo has a bug left where with multiple redo's the interface returns the last undone item also multiple times. However, this is not so much a problem but rather our choice for a function-based undo-redo.
•	The filter select is not working with the database. We have not created a search functionality. The ‘+ button' on the beverage card is not functional. Items cannot be removed from the order list by using the ‘x’, and the quantity cannot be increased and decreased. Nevertheless, we have chosen to keep these features in the interface because we want to emphasize the importance of these features in an interface designed for a pub. 

Description of the work distribution
Part 1: designing the interface. We all worked on designing the interface of the Flying Dutchman. This was done in a couple of project meetings where we collaborated simultaneously in Figma to design the various screens of the interface. This way we could make decisions together and help each other where necessary. 

Part 2: programming the interface. We also all worked on programming the interface of the Flying Dutchman. We separated the programming task into smaller, more manageable tasks. This way we could each work on the functionalities on separate branches in git, and later merge the finished components into the final product. We believe this maximised the efficiency throughout the project, and we were challenged to learn by ourselves, but also from each other.
